## Dev Tools - Getting Started with the Debugger
These instructions are intended to help faculty and students get started doing development with DevTools and the Debugger in particular. In fall 2017, I (Heidi Ellis) have been working with Gabriel Luong (@gl on Slack) and Jason Laster (@jlast on Slack). 
1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your platform. 
1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
1. Install the DevTools Debugger dev environment according to: https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html/blob/master/docs/getting-setup.md (Steps 1 and 2 only, don't go into Next Steps) 
   1. Note that you may have to install [yarn][yarn-install]
   1. Note that the `yarn install` command may result in multiple warnings, this is normal. 
   1. When you reach the `yarn start` command, you may see a message: `WS connection closed, disconnected from TCP`. This does not appear to interfere with the tool.
   1. Once you have started yarn (you will **not** get your prompt back).
1. Open a new Firefox or Chrome window and enter: `localhost:8000` in the URL. The Debugger may take several minutes to load. 
1. If you have a successful install, you should see something like:

![Launchpad](/images/launchpad.png)

This is the “LaunchPad”.  The launchpad is an application that runs on a web server and launches “clean” instances of Firefox or Chrome.  
* You need these “clean” instances as these will be running off of the code that you downloaded, not running off the binaries included with the Firefox browser. Therefore you need these “clean” instances to test the changes you make in the debugger code. 
* These “clean” instances do not use your Firefox or Chrome profile and therefore will have none of your add-ons or book marks. 
* The purpose of these “clean” instances is to allow you to run the debugger in a sandbox without interference with any addons you may have in your profile. 
If you are on Firefox and see only a browser with no launchpad, try using Chrome and vice versa.  When I tried this some of my adblocker or Privacy Badger software was blocking the launchpad from coming up. 
6. Click on the “Launch Firefox” button.  
7. A successful launch of a “clean” instance of Firefox will appear as below. Note that this may take several (5) minutes to appear. We will call this the “display” window. 

![Display Window](/images/displaywindow.png)

8. To run the debugger, go to the “launchpad” instance of Firefox. You should see something like: 

![Debugger Start](/images/debuggerstart.png)

9. Click on the “Debugger Examples | Collection of good debugging examples” link. If this takes you to the “Debugger Examples”, go back, wait, and try again. If you are successful, you should see the following in the “launchpad” window: 
  
![Display Window](/images/launchpadstart.png)

   1. The “launchpad” window now contains the debugger that is running off the code that you installed. You should see any changes in your code in this window. 
   1. The “launchpad” window allows you to debug the code shown in the “display” window.  
### Notes: 
* It appears that the DevTools are installed in a central location. Therefore, once installed, they will appear with all instances of Firefox, both “clean” and those running from your profile. 
* It can be difficult to differentiate between the “clean” instances of Firefox and those running from your profile. In my case, I have set up bookmark folders in my top toolbar so I can tell the difference with a quick glance. 
* Remember that we are working on code that debugs other code which can get confusing. The code that is displayed in the Debugger is application code and not the code that we are interested in. The code that we are interested in is the code that actually executes the Debugger and is located in the directory debugger.html.
* If the examples do not automatically launch, you can open them using the following URL: http://firefox-dev.tools/debugger-examples/
